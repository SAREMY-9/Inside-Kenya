# Inside-Kenya
# This is a project that  I did as a blog for Kenyan tourism
# The few major tourism sites we have in Kenya.
# The main purpose was to do a responsive static website that will showcase a great view of the sites 
# The layout was influenced by a lowkey view of the different sceneries.
# You'll see the different styles in action here.
# Working hand in hand to make the web pages look very appealing.
